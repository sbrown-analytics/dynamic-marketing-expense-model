---

## 📊 Key Features

- **Dynamic Date Range Selector**  
  Choose start/end months via dropdowns (cells N2 & N3). All calculations update automatically.

- **Dynamic Formulas (INDEX + XMATCH)**  
  ‘Match’ date headers to columns, then pull actual values for summing without the restrictions of hard‑coding.

- **Uniform Logic**  (Updated)
  Subtotal rows now use XMATCH just like detail rows, ensuring formula consistency and robust handling of date formatting changes.

- **Conditional Formatting**  
  Dark‑blue fill applied to the header row (B6:M6) for the selected months to enhance UX without clutter.
